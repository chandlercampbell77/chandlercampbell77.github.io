Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

The time from 10 simulations to 100 is very similar. Therefore, we should always use at least 100 simulations.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

I think 10,000 simulations is good enough because after that you are going to be paying nearly 8 times as much when the accuracy isn't getting 8 times better.
