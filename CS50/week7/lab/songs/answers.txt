Question:
If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

Answer:
I would characterize their audio aura as yellow because if you take the average value of the averages of energy, valence, and danceability in the top 100 songs list, you would get a number around 0.61. Yellow seems to be around this value becuase yellow is motivated yet methodical.

Question:
Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

Answer:
Music choice is largely influenced by what's popular at the time. So a person that is sadder than average could still have an aura profile including yellow. To fix this, we could remove any songs from the top 100 overall from their top 100 songs. This makes it more likely they we are looking at their individual taste rather than society's.
